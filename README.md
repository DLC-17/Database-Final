# Database-Final
The final for my Database Programming class analyzing the information stored within the Lahman's Baseball database. The Project was made using SQL, MySQL Workbench and Tableau. Utilizing My SQL workbench in I exported the data as excel sheets and used Tableau to create visual representations of the data to present to my teacher on the statistics regarding teams competing from 2000-2003 with a focus centralized on one particular team, the Chicago Cubs.
